# M21 - Book Search Engine

## Description

Book Search Engine is a web app that allows a user to search for books. After searching for said book the user can save a book to their profile for later reference. This app was built in order to practice REACT, GraphQl, and the full MERN Stack. 

While building this project I learned to:
- Deploy a MongoDB database to heroku using MongoDB Atlas
- Structure routes to a database using GraphQl instead of making a RESTful API
- Make front end queries to send information to the back end using GraphQl

## Usage

This section will describe how to use the website both from a regular users perspective and from a developers perspective. See website and developer sub-sections below.

### Website

As a user you may add notes to the application. It will save your notes to a database so you may leave the page and have the notes stay. 

Should you wish to have access to the text editor on your local device merely hitthe `Install` button at the top left of the screen. All of your notes will carry over.

### Developer

From your terminal, run `npm run start:dev` in order to generate a `dist` folder. You will see that within the dist we have a condensed Progressive Web Application.

In order to see the application at work navigate to [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) .
